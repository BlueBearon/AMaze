# AMaze
Android App for playing Maze navigation game.

Created by Chase Packer.
Original base code by Paul Falstad.
Edited code by Peter Kemper.
Specifically designed for use on Android API 29, Nexus 6 device

This project was completed as a part of course taken at the College of William and Mary
(CSCI 301: Software Development).  I was given a code base originally developed by Paul
Falstad and edited by my instructor Peter Kemper.  We were tasked with completing multiple
projects to add functionality and change the program.  The projects were as follows:

P2:  Implement Boruvka's algorithm to generate mazes
(The original algorithm and Prim's algorithm were already given)
-MazeBuilderBoruvka.java

P3:  Create an algorithm to automatically navigate the maze.
-Wizard.java
-ReliableRobot.java
-ReliableSensor.java
 
P4:  Create another navigation algorithm that can deal with "sensor failures"
-Wallfollower.java
-UnreliableRobot.java
-UnreliableSensor.java
-WizardJump.java

P5:  Refactor the code so that drawing operations are contained in a wrapper class MazePanel, preparing for transition to Android

P6:  Create a base GUI for the game in Android
-AMazeActivity.java
-GeneratingActivity.java
-PlayManuallyActivity.java
-PlayAnimationActivity.java
-WinningActivity.java
-LosingActivity.java

P7:  Finish the android app
-PlayingActivity.java
-PlayingControl.java
-SensorStatusWidget.java
